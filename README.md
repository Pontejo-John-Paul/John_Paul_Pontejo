its structure. Also this will help me to know how to build and connect it perfectly. Not only me will learned 
in this subject but also my classmates. Because of this subject our knowledge will grow more.

I'm thinking also that this subject will develop my skills through different platforms and environment
and this subject also will provide to me and my classmates knowledge needed to analyze, design, and integrate systems effectively. 
I also want to learned the principles behind this subject system integration and architecture that will help me to solve problems.
